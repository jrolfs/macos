# Per-display-configuration settings, applied as one script that Stay calls.
#
# Stay's own actions used to hold the logic: four shell/AppleScript bodies per
# workspace, thirty-three in total, with the values scattered across a Core Data
# store that nothing here could see. This keeps Stay as the trigger, because its
# display-configuration matching already works, and moves everything it does
# into one generated script.
#
# The Electron apps are the reason this exists. Superhuman and Slack have no
# settable zoom: Slack persists `.settings.zoomLevel` in
# storage/root-state.json but only reads it at startup, and Superhuman does not
# persist zoom at all (its `partition.per_host_zoom_levels` stays empty), so
# something has to drive the UI. The old actions did that with System Events
# keystrokes, which meant activating each app in turn and stealing focus.
#
# Hammerspoon's selectMenuItem presses the menu item through the accessibility
# API instead, which works on an application that is not frontmost and never
# raises it. Verified against Slack with kitty focused throughout. It also drops
# Stay's TCC dependency entirely: Stay now runs a plain shell script, and the
# Accessibility grant that matters belongs to Hammerspoon, which already has it.
#
# Zoom is set absolutely, Actual Size then N steps, never relatively. Chromium
# coalesces rapid zoom changes and writes the result back on a lag, so a
# relative step applied to an unknown starting point drifts. The old AppleScript
# opened with Cmd+0 for the same reason.

  # kitty is a font size in points. moomGap is Moom's grid gap in pixels.
  # superhuman and slack are Chromium zoom levels, where 0 is 100% and each
  # step is one notch, so -2 means two presses of Zoom Out.
  #

  # marked `inferred` had no action at all, or in the case of 13" M4 Air's Slack
  # entry an action with an empty script, and follow the pattern of the rest:
  # -1/-3 on the low-DPI externals, 0/-2 on Retina.
