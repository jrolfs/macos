  # Connect Tailscale everywhere except at home, without touching macOS's
  # on-demand VPN machinery.
  #
  # Tailscale's own "VPN on demand" delegates the decision to NEOnDemandRule,
  # which re-evaluates on every link flap, roam and wake, routinely before the
  # tunnel has settled. When nesessionmanager tears the tunnel down out from
  # under the client, the client never runs its teardown path, so
  # 100.100.100.100 stays installed as the system resolver with nothing behind
  # it and *all* name resolution dies until the next reconnect. That is the
  # "breaks my network altogether" failure, and it is a property of who makes
  # the call, not of which rules are configured.
  #
  # So the decision is made here and applied through the client's own LocalAPI
  # (`tailscale up` / `tailscale down`), which is a graceful transition that
  # restores DNS. macOS is never asked to arbitrate, so there is nothing to
  # flap. Tailscale's built-in on-demand must be off for this to hold: see
  # the note at the bottom of this file.
  #
  # The MDM route (`AlwaysOn.Enabled` and friends) is not reachable here: the
  # client reads those keys with `-objectIsForcedForKey:` against
  # /Library/Managed Preferences/io.tailscale.ipn.macsys.plist, which is derived
  # from the SIP-protected profile store. A plain `defaults write` is ignored,
  # `profiles` has no install verb, and the device channel belongs to Kandji.
  # `tailscale syspolicy list` confirms nothing is forced today.

  # Home is fingerprinted by default-gateway IP + gateway MAC, not by SSID.
  # Since Sonoma the SSID is redacted for any process without a CoreLocation
  # grant (`ipconfig getsummary en0` prints `SSID : <redacted>`, and
  # `networksetup -getairportnetwork` lies outright with "You are not
  # associated with an AirPort network"). The gateway pair needs no
  # entitlement, is cheap enough to sample every few seconds, and keeps working
  # over Ethernet. Format is `<gateway ip>/<gateway mac>`; either MAC spelling
  # works, both sides get zero-padded before comparison.
