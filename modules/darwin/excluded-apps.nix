  # into /Applications, and a cask refuses to clobber an app it doesn't own —
  # so the first switch failed on both. Note this excludes the 1Password
  # *GUI* only: `1password-cli` is a separate cask, is brew-managed here, and
  # is what `op` needs, so it stays.
  #
  # Xcode is excluded for a different reason: it's a many-GB App Store install
  # that would dominate provisioning time.
