# One Full Disk Access grant, shared by everything that needs one.
#
# TCC evaluates a grant against the Mach-O binary being executed, so FDA cannot
# be given to a shell script (the grant lands on /bin/bash) nor to a nix store
# path (which moves on every rebuild). The grant therefore sits on a single
# compiled shim at a fixed /usr/local/bin path, and every operation needing that
# access is reached through it. Each new FDA-hungry tool would otherwise cost
# another manual approval, and nix-darwin's activation cannot stand in for one:
# it writes user defaults through `launchctl asuser ... sudo --user=...`, which
# holds no grant of its own.
#
# The shim is ad-hoc signed, so TCC has no stable signing identity to key the
# grant on and falls back to the cdhash, a hash of the binary's bytes. Any
# rebuild that perturbs them revokes the grant, silently. That is a real
# recurring failure rather than a theoretical one, and it used to surface only
# as icons mysteriously no longer updating, which is why the dispatcher probes
# for the grant and announces its absence instead of failing mutely. Signing the
# shim with a stable identity would fix the revocation at the root, but that
# needs a trusted certificate in the System keychain and so belongs with the
# bootstrap chain in SECRETS.md.
