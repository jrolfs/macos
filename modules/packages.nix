# `environment.systemPackages` is spelled the same in nix-darwin and NixOS, so
# one module serves both and there is a single place to add a tool. Before this
# existed the NixOS list was a hand-maintained subset of the darwin one — which
# meant the answer to "why isn't `rg` on the NUC" was that nobody had copied the
# line across yet, and the two drifted every time either changed.
#
# What stays out: anything that only means something on one platform (see the
# lists in modules/darwin and modules/nixos), and anything heavy enough that a
# host should opt into it rather than receive it by default.

    # pnpm, so scripts and dependencies still complete outside a project shell.
    # modules/home zsh config merges it with pnpm's own completion.
