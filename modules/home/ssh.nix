# Who is allowed to connect *in*. The outbound direction needs nothing here —
# bootstrap imports the GPG key from 1Password and gpg-agent serves it over
# SSH_AUTH_SOCK — and since that same key is the only identity that should ever
# reach these machines, authorized_keys is derived from it on the machine
# rather than distributed to it. Nothing secret is committed and there is no
# per-host key to collect.
#
# The file is written rather than symlinked because sshd's StrictModes check
# walks the resolved path, and /nix/store is group-writable: a store symlink
# here would be silently refused. (The same check rules out an
# AuthorizedKeysCommand pointing into the store, which would otherwise avoid
# needing a file at all.)
#
# This owns the file outright, so a key added by hand will be replaced on the
# next switch.
#
# On a machine being provisioned the first switch is a no-op: `gpg` and
# ~/.gnupg are both outputs of that switch, so bootstrap can only import the
# key afterwards, and there is nothing to export while activation is running.
# The file appears on the next switch instead. That's deliberate rather than a
# gap to paper over — inbound SSH isn't needed during bootstrap, and running
# on every activation is what keeps the file true afterwards.
