# Raycast extensions that exist only on a branch of the jrolfs/extensions fork:
# ones written here and not yet accepted into the store, and other people's
# carrying a local fix. Each stays installed and usable until upstream
# publishes it, at which point dropping its entry from `tracked` below and
# removing the extension in Raycast hands the slot back to the store copy.
#
# Raycast has no declarative install. Its extension registry lives in
# SQLCipher-encrypted databases (settings_v2.db, node_extensions.db), so
# nothing outside the app can add a row. Everything *around* that registry is
# ordinary filesystem, though, and that is enough:
#
#   - Store extensions unpack into ~/.config/raycast/extensions/<uuid>/, but a
#     development extension lands in ~/.config/raycast/extensions/<name>/,
#     keyed by the `name` in its manifest. `ray build` computes precisely that
#     path when no --output is given (@raycast/api,
#     dist/utils/raycast-app-communication.js) and writes the bundled commands,
#     the processed package.json and assets/ into it. That directory is the
#     whole installed artifact.
#   - Registration is a deep link, not an API. The CLI shells out to
#     `/usr/bin/open -g -b com.raycast.macos
#     raycast://cli/<name>/<event>?cwd=<source>&info=`, where `start` and
#     `stop` bracket a `ray develop` session. Firing those by hand registers
#     the extension exactly as the watcher would, and `stop` does not
#     uninstall: bundle and registration both outlive it. A dev session lasting
#     two deep links is a permanent install.
#
# So the activation below *is* the install. Build into the directory Raycast
# reads, then tell Raycast to read it.
#
# The source is a worktrunk worktree of the fork rather than a checkout of its
# own, so the copy that is installed and the one `wt switch <branch>` lands in
# are the same tree. `wt dev` then hot-reloads the extension that is actually
# installed, and the branch it reloads from is the one that becomes the PR.
# ~/.config/worktrunk/config.toml drives that half and scopes each worktree's
# sparse cone from the branch name. What it cannot do is create the clone or
# set the per-clone partial-clone config its `sync` and `extension` aliases
# depend on, which is why both are done here.

let
  # Extension directory under extensions/, mapped to the branch carrying it.
  # The directory name is also the manifest `name`, hence the install path.
