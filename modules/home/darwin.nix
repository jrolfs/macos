  # reads only its own set-environment, and home-manager's zsh integration is
  # inert while .zshrc is a lifted dotfile. The aliases were expanding to
  # `--flake #ala`.
  #
  # The hostname is the one this configuration was evaluated for, and it is what
  # selected this configuration in the first place, so asking the running system
  # was only ever a slower route to the same answer — and a wrong one if the
  # machine is mid-rename.

  # gpg-agent execs pinentry-program fresh for every passphrase prompt, so
  # dispatching at that moment is what lets the `pin` toggle
  # (dotfiles/home/.config/zsh/init/gpg.zsh) be a one-line state file write with
  # no agent reload — and lets gpg-agent.conf stay a read-only store symlink
  # rather than something sed rewrites in place, which is what it used to be.
  #
  # Curses only works if there is a terminal to draw in, which rules it out for
  # anything a GUI starts — Zed's built-in git, say. That can't be detected
  # here: pinentry is a child of the daemon, so it has no tty of its own,
  # /dev/tty won't open, TERM is always "dumb", and the client's real tty
  # arrives over assuan as `OPTION ttyname` only *after* this has already
  # exec'd. The one thing gpg does put in the environment beforehand is
  # PINENTRY_USER_DATA, forwarded per-invocation as `OPTION putenv=`, so the
  # client has to say what it is rather than be sniffed.
  #
  # Interactive zsh sets `tty=<path>`; the path is checked instead of trusted
  # because a GUI app launched from a terminal inherits that terminal's
  # environment, and a long-lived agent keeps the environment of whichever
  # client happened to start it. macOS frees the pty node outright when a
  # terminal closes, so a marker that has outlived its terminal fails -c.
  #
  # Everything else — no marker, an unknown one, a terminal that has since gone
  # away — falls through to the GUI dialog, which is the direction that always
  # works: mac in a terminal is merely surprising, curses without one cannot
  # prompt at all.
  #
  # XDG_STATE_HOME is honoured if gpg-agent happens to have it, but the fallback
  # is an absolute path rather than $HOME/… — gpg-agent hands its child a
  # controlled environment, and a missing HOME here would silently mean "not
  # mac" forever.
