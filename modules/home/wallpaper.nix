# The desktop picture.
#
# The image files sync themselves: ~/Images is a Resilio share, and
# ~/Images/Wallpapers is the library inside it. What was never synced is the
# *choice* — a machine with the entire library still had to be told which
# picture to use, by hand, in System Settings. That is what this declares.
#
# It cannot be declared as a preference. macOS keeps the answer in
# ~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.wallpaper/Store/Index.plist, and
# WallpaperAgent owns that file rather than reading it: writing the new picture
# in by hand changes nothing on screen, and the agent overwrites the file from
# its own state the next time Dock restarts. Measured on macOS 26.
#
# So the picture is set through NSWorkspace, the only public way in, and the
# work of doing that lives in Hammerspoon — see
# dotfiles/home/.hammerspoon/modules/wallpaper.lua. Hammerspoon is already the
# place this config keeps the macOS APIs that have no declarative surface, it
# exposes NSWorkspace as hs.screen:desktopImageURL, and it is the only thing
# here that can see the other spaces at all — which is how the picture reaches
# more than the one space that happens to be active, without a switch ever
# taking the screen to do it.
