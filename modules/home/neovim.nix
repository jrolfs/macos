# sessions the kitty layout loads, and the two things that have to happen on a
# machine that has never seen either.
#
# The config is its own repo (jrolfs/neovim) and it is edited from a clone, not
# from the pinned input. Sourced from the input, every file under ~/.config/nvim
# was a read-only store symlink: `:w` on the config failed outright, and the
# loop for a one-line lua tweak was commit → push → `nix flake update
# neovim-config` → switch. The input still pins the *provenance* — it's what
# supplies the list of things to link, and what a machine without the clone
# would need — but the links point at the working copy.
