# Zed itself is the Homebrew cask, and its config directory is linked wholesale
# in default.nix (Zed writes settings.json back from the UI, so the whole dir
# is an out-of-store symlink into the repo). Registry extensions ride the
# `auto_install_extensions` key in settings.json — Zed installs anything listed
# there that's missing, and never uninstalls, so the list converges a fresh
# machine and re-adds anything deleted by hand.
#
# What that key can't express is the dev extension: gruvbox-material-custom,
# which carries both the theme and the TypeScript/TSX/JSON(C) language
# overrides. Zed decides an extension is a dev extension purely by the entry
# under extensions/installed/ being a symlink (extension_host.rs:
# `is_dev = metadata.is_symlink`; index.json is just a cache it rebuilds), and
# "install dev extension" does nothing but compile the grammars and plant that
# symlink — so declaring the symlink *is* the install.

  # credential prompt would hang the switch with nothing on screen to explain
  # why. The remote stays HTTPS, which a normal shell rewrites to SSH via the
  # config's insteadOf, so pushing from the clone works as usual.
