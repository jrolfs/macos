# AccountsService is what asks on this side: greeters and the desktops' own
# settings panels read it over DBus rather than touching the home directory. It
# keeps per-user state under /var/lib/AccountsService, where an account whose
# keyfile carries no `Icon=` falls back to icons/<user>. So the image is the
# whole declaration, and the keyfile stays the daemon's, which rewrites it as
# sessions come and go.
#
# ~/.face is the older convention and still the one anything that reads the
# home directory instead of DBus will look for, so it gets the same image.
#
# Imported from desktop.nix rather than modules/nixos/default.nix, on the same
# reasoning that file already makes: a headless host has nothing to draw this
# on. Which is nearly irulan today, with no greeter yet and
# services.accounts-daemon off, so declaring it now is what makes the picture
# already right the day one arrives.
