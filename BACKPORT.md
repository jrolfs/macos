# Backport candidates

Fixes made on this branch (`migration-flake`) that are worth applying to the
**pre-migration** setup too — i.e. `macos` master and the `dot` / `private`
castles — because `newt` runs that setup until phase 3 (see `MIGRATION.md`).

Nothing here is required for the migration itself. This is the list of "I found
a real bug while migrating and my daily driver still has it."

Format: what, why it matters before the migration lands, and where it goes.

---

## 1. `OP_CONFIG_DIR` pointed at the private castle — **highest value**

**Commit here:** `f05e569`

`op`'s config holds *device-local* state: account registrations keyed to a
per-device UUID. Pointing every machine at one synced copy in the private
castle makes them fight — each machine's signin invalidates the others'. This
surfaced provisioning Ala, where `homeshick link private` replaced the freshly
created `~/.config/op/config` with a symlink to newt's state and broke `op`.

This is live on `newt` right now, and it gets worse with each additional
machine.

Confirmed broken on `newt`, not merely untidy — against the redirected config
`op` cannot resolve its own session:

```
$ op whoami
[ERROR] multiple accounts found. Use the --account flag or …
$ OP_CONFIG_DIR=~/.config/op op whoami
URL: https://rolfers.1password.com/   # works
```

Both configs register the same two accounts, so what the redirect loses is the
desktop-app integration state that lets `op` pick one. Any tool shelling out to
`op` without an explicit account fails here today.

**Backport to:**
- `dot`: drop `export OP_CONFIG_DIR=...` from `home/.zshenv`
- `dot`: drop the `OP_CONFIG_DIR` entry from
  `home/.config/glide/one-password.ts`'s `OP_ENV`
- `private`: `git rm --cached home/.config/op/config` (device-local). Keep
  `home/.config/op/plugins/gh.json` — it's item UUIDs, which are portable.

## 2. Private Homebrew tap can't clone on a fresh machine

**Commit here:** `3f4c47d`

`meterup/homebrew-packages` is private, and brew taps over HTTPS with
`GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`, so a machine without a cached GitHub credential fails
with `could not read Username`, taking `mcurl` / `mctl` / `hostsfile` down with
it. It only works on newt because a credential happens to sit in the keychain
(plus `credential.helper = !gh auth git-credential` in the git config) — none of
which is reproducible.

Fix: pin the tap to SSH so it uses the SSH key the machine already has.

```nix
{
  name = "meterup/packages";
  clone_target = "git@github.com:meterup/homebrew-packages.git";
  trusted = true;
}
```

**Backport to:** `macos` master, `home/.nixpkgs/homebrew.nix`. Requires a
nix-darwin with attrset taps — master already uses `{ name = …; trusted = …; }`,
so `clone_target` should be available too. Verify before relying on it.

---

## 3. Duplicate `insteadOf` in the git config

**Commit here:** (this commit)

`home/.config/git/config` declared the same rewrite twice with different
targets:

```
[url "git@github.com:"]        insteadOf = https://github.com/
[url "ssh://git@github.com/"]  insteadOf = https://github.com/
```

Identical `insteadOf` values mean which one wins is effectively arbitrary.
Harmless in practice (both resolve to the same SSH clone) but confusing.
Removed the `ssh://` form, kept the documented scp-form one.

**Backport to:** `dot`, `home/.config/git/config`.

---

## 4. A dead `source` line in the kitty startup session

**Commit here:** (this commit)

`sessions/startup.conf`'s `source ~/.config/zsh/init/keys.zsh` is not a kitty
session directive — the parser has no `source` (checked in 0.47.2 and on kitty
master), so it's rejected with `Unknown command in session file`. It's also
unnecessary: `.zshrc` snippets every `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/zsh/init/*.zsh`, which is
where `private` plants `keys.zsh`.

The same commit originally joined `kitty.conf`'s two-line `symbol_map` as well.
That part was a regression and is reverted — see the last entry under *not
backport candidates*.

**Backport to:** `dot`, `home/.config/kitty/sessions/startup.conf`.

---

## 5. kitty-scrollback.nvim alias pointed at the vim-plug plugin dir

**Commit here:** (this commit)

`bindings.conf`'s `action_alias` named
`~/.local/share/nvim/plugged-kitty/kitty-scrollback.nvim/python/kitty_scrollback_nvim.py`,
but the neovim config moved to `vim.pack`, which installs into
`~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/core/opt/`. Nothing creates `plugged-kitty` any
more, so `ctrl+s>]`, `ctrl+s>[` and the ctrl+shift+right mouse map all fail on a
fresh machine.

`zsh/init/neovim.zsh` has the same stale path in `$VISUAL` for the ctrl+e
command-line editing integration.

It still works on `newt` only by accident: a March vim-plug leftover is sitting
in `plugged-kitty`, and its kitten is byte-identical to the current one. It
breaks there the moment `plugged*` gets cleaned up.

Neither path needs a home baked into it. kitty expands `~` in kitten paths
(verified against 0.47.2's `AliasMap`), and the zsh one takes
`${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}`.

**Backport to:** `dot`, `home/.config/kitty/bindings.conf` and
`home/.config/zsh/init/neovim.zsh`.

---

## 6. `exa-wrapper.sh` still calls `exa`, and two of its flags never worked

**Commit here:** (this commit)

`ls` is this wrapper. It ends in `exa …`, and exa has been unmaintained and gone
from nixpkgs for years — the name only resolves because nixpkgs' `eza` ships a
`bin/exa` compat symlink, which is also the only reason `aliases.zsh`'s
`command -v exa` guard still defines the alias at all. Both now name `eza`, as
does the file itself: `eza-wrapper.sh`, with `exa_opts` renamed to match. The
rename is the one part that has to land atomically — the script and the alias
that points at it are both in `dot`, so that's one commit there.

Two flags the wrapper's own `--help` advertises have never worked, in any
version: `-I GLOBS` and `-L DEPTH` are missing their colons in the `getopts`
optstring, so the value is left in `$@` as a path and the flag reaches eza bare
— `a value is required for '--level <DEPTH>'`, and the same for `--ignore-glob`.
`ls -T -L 2` and `ls -I '*.o'` are hard errors today.

Also `--color-scale` and `--icons` take *optional* values in eza, and clap
swallows the following token as the value unless it starts with a dash. The
invocation only survives that because two unconditional flags are appended after
them; `--color-scale=all --icons=auto` is what the bare forms already resolve to
(verified byte-for-byte, so nothing about the output changes) and it doesn't
depend on argument order.

`dir="$@" || dir=.` is dead as written — an assignment always succeeds, so the
`.` fallback never happened, and multiple arguments were joined with spaces into
one nonexistent path. Only `--git` auto-detection rode on it, and only for a
directory argument: `git -C ""` is a documented no-op, so the no-argument case
worked by accident, while `ls -l some-file` in a repo never got the git column.

**Backport to:** `dot`, `home/.local/share/exa-wrapper.sh` (renamed to
`eza-wrapper.sh`) and `home/.config/zsh/init/aliases.zsh`.

Not applicable to master: the "never linked" half of this (see MIGRATION.md) is a
flake-only defect. On newt homeshick links both files out of `dot`.

## Explicitly *not* backport candidates

- **Dropping `homebrew.onActivation.extraFlags = [ "--force-cleanup" ]`.** On
  this branch nix-darwin passes it itself, so ours was a duplicate. Master pins
  an older nix-darwin that does *not*, so master still needs it. Leave alone;
  it resolves itself when master's nix-darwin advances (or at phase 3).
- **Removing the `insteadOf` unset/restore dance from `homebrew.nix`**
  (`bf9b60f`). Only safe here because a bootstrapped machine has a
  passphraseless `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` that needs no agent, and because
  `clone_target` now covers the private tap. Newt's SSH is gpg-agent-backed, so
  the workaround may still be doing real work there.
- **Anything that only exists because of the flake layout** — pure-eval fixes
  (`getEnv` → `specialArgs`, `builtins.currentTime` in `pin.nix`),
  `$NIX_CONFIG_DIR` in `tap.nix`, registry pins. These are migration artifacts,
  meaningless pre-migration.
- **Joining `kitty.conf`'s two-line `symbol_map`** (`f708bf3`, reverted in
  `a6eb730`). The mapping has never parsed, so every Nerd Font glyph has always
  come from kitty's fallback — and that fallback is what makes the tab icons look
  right. Measured with `get_fallback_font` at `font_size 13.0`: the private-use
  codepoints in the tab templates (U+E606, U+E69D, U+EDAF, …) resolve to the
  `Symbols Nerd Font Mono` kitty bundles in its own app bundle, and the Material
  Design Icons plane (U+F0001+) to the natural-width `FiraCode Nerd Font`. Making
  the mapping live pins all of them to `JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Mono`, a patched
  single-cell face, which renders them noticeably smaller and inconsistently —
  only two of the ten tab icons were even inside the mapped ranges. kitty's own
  FAQ says not to use patched fonts for this. `kitty.conf` now comments the
  mapping out with that reasoning rather than leaving two lines kitty rejects on
  every launch.
