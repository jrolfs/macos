# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code (claude.ai/code) working in this repository.

## What This Is

One flake that configures every machine Jamie owns, macOS and Linux alike,
from a single source. `nix-darwin` builds the macOS systems, `home-manager`
owns the dotfiles, and `nixpkgs` is pinned by `flake.lock`.

It deploys to `~/.config/system` on a machine.

Hosts (`flake.nix`):

| Attribute | Machine |
|---|---|
| `darwinConfigurations.ala` | MacBook Air M4, personal |
| `darwinConfigurations.adrian` | MacBook Air M5, work, MDM-managed |
| `nixosConfigurations.irulan` | Beelink NUC home server (`x86_64-linux`) |

`newt` is the retired work laptop that `adrian` replaces. Its attribute is
commented out in `flake.nix`, but the machine still runs the pre-flake
configuration (the `pre-flake` branch plus the `macos` homeshick castle), which
makes it the reference for anything not yet migrated. See MIGRATION.md.

The migration from homeshick castles and nix channels is still in progress. The
`private` castle deliberately stays a castle (git-crypt), which is why
`$HOMESHICK_KINGDOM` is still exported. SECRETS.md covers that half.

## Key Commands

```bash
# Build and activate this host. Defined in modules/home/darwin.nix, not a
# plain alias: it takes flags.
nix-switch
nix-switch --brew       # run `brew bundle` even if the Brewfile is unchanged
nix-switch --no-brew    # skip it for one switch
nix-switch --update     # refresh flake.lock first (--update=nixpkgs for one input)

nix-rebuild             # build without activating
nix-update              # nix flake update, optionally per-input
homebrew-gate status    # whether the next switch will run `brew bundle`

velja-rules diff        # has Velja drifted from modules/darwin/velja/rules.toml?
velja-rules capture --write   # pull GUI-authored rules back into rules.toml
velja-rules apply       # push rules.toml into Velja without a full switch

icn                     # apply custom app icons (icons/apply.sh)
mkbk / mkrs             # mackup backup / restore
spoon                   # the Hammerspoon CLI (`hs` is homeshick)
```

`brew bundle` is the slowest part of a switch and is gated on a content hash of
the Brewfile, so most switches skip it. That gate is the reason `--brew` exists:
a version bump inside a `jrolfs/tap` cask does not change the Brewfile.

On Linux hosts `nix-switch` wraps `nixos-rebuild` instead.

## Layout

```
flake.nix          inputs, the three host configurations, the `glide` devShell
modules/
  darwin/          macOS system configuration (nix-darwin)
  home/            home-manager, shared plus darwin.nix / linux.nix
  nixos/           NixOS system configuration
  packages.nix     packages every machine gets
  bootstrap.nix    the `bootstrap` CLI, for 1Password-backed secrets
  home-backup.nix  what home-manager does with an unmanaged file in its way
hosts/             per-host overrides: ala, adrian, irulan (+ irulan/disko.nix)
dotfiles/home/     the dotfile tree, linked into $HOME by modules/home
homebrew/          IS the jrolfs/tap, symlinked into brew's Taps directory
icons/             .icns assets plus apply.sh
karabiner/         live Karabiner config, out-of-store symlinked so it can write back
overlays/          nixpkgs overlays, plus pin.nix for single-package pins
automator/         macOS Automator workflows
vscodium/          separate flake building VSCodium with extensions
links/             convenience symlink to /Library/LaunchDaemons
```

### modules/darwin

| Module | What it does |
|---|---|
| `defaults.nix` | `system.defaults`, the bulk of the macOS preferences |
| `homebrew.nix` | casks, brews, taps, and the `brew bundle` gate |
| `tap.nix` | symlinks `homebrew/` into place; `cask-updater` bumps the casks |
| `mas.nix` | App Store installs, driving `mas` directly (not via `brew bundle`) |
| `spotlight.nix` | keeps Spotlight indexing on, which `mas list` depends on |
| `excluded-apps.nix` | per-host cask/App Store exclusions, read by both of the above |
| `login-items.nix` | login items via System Events, since the BTM store is SIP-locked |
| `startup.nix` | Spotify and Fantastical autostart, via their own settings |
| `daemons.nix` | launchd user agents, for headless things only |
| `tailscale.nix` | connect Tailscale everywhere except at home |
| `finder-sidebar.nix` | Finder sidebar Favorites, via `mysides` |
| `folder-icons.nix` | SF Symbol / emoji icons on `$HOME` folders, over Resilio's |
| `default-browser.nix` | Velja as the http(s) router |
| `velja/` | Velja's settings, plus `rules.toml` and the `velja-rules` CLI |
| `icons.nix` / `fileicon.nix` | custom app icons and the tool that sets them |
| `sidecar.nix` | Sidecar (iPad as display) via the private SidecarCore framework |
| `glide-developer.nix` | a second Glide copy with its own bundle identifier |
| `kaset.nix` | source build with the native-PiP patch, or the stock cask |
| `spicetify.nix` | Spotify theming |

### modules/home

`default.nix` links `dotfiles/home` into `$HOME`, `darwin.nix` and `linux.nix`
are the per-platform shared modules, and the rest are subject-specific:
`neovim.nix` (owns all of `~/.config/nvim`), `browsers.nix`, `zed.nix`,
`ssh.nix`, `atuin.nix`, `wallpaper.nix`, `icloud.nix`, `claude-sync.nix`.

## Companion docs

Read the relevant one before changing that area. They carry the reasoning that
would otherwise have to be rediscovered.

| File | Covers |
|---|---|
| `NIX-DARWIN.md` | every nix-darwin module, and whether this repo uses it |
| `MIGRATION.md` | the homeshick-to-flake migration, phases and gotchas |
| `RECONCILIATION.md` | the castle-to-flake file sweep, and what still needs a decision |
| `BACKPORT.md` | fixes found here that newt's pre-flake setup still needs |
| `HOMEBREW.md` | how far Homebrew determinism goes, why `brew pin` and nix-homebrew don't get there |
| `SECRETS.md` | why secrets sit outside the flake, and the bootstrap dependency chain |
| `homebrew/README.md` | the tap itself, and bumping a cask with `cask-updater` |

## Conventions

- Flakes only. `nix.nixPath` and the registry are pinned to the flake's inputs
  in `modules/darwin/default.nix`, so `nix shell nixpkgs#foo` resolves to the
  same nixpkgs the system was built from.
- `allowUnfree`, `allowBroken` and `allowUnsupportedSystem` are all on.
- Homebrew cleanup is `zap`, so any cask not listed is removed on the next
  switch. `onActivation.upgrade` is `true`, which is deliberate and argued in
  `homebrew.nix`.
- Touch ID for sudo via `security.pam.services.sudo_local.touchIdAuth`.
- `nix.package` is pinned to Lix 2.94 because devbox needs
  `builtins.fetchClosure`, which Lix 2.95 removed.
- Comments explain *why*, not what. Most modules here open with a paragraph on
  the failure they exist to prevent; match that rather than summarising the
  code.
- The repo's own small tools are Rust, built by `pkgs.rustTool` (and
  `pkgs.rustLibrary` for code they share) in `overlays/default.nix`. One
  `rustc` for all of them, invoked bare rather than through Cargo, so a tool is
  a single `.rs` file in `modules/darwin/pkgs/` with no manifest or lock file.
  That overlay is also where the non-obvious flags are explained; add tools
  through it rather than calling `rustc` or `$CC` from a module. `sidecar.swift`
  stays Swift because it needs the macOS SDK's private frameworks.

## Gotchas

- **`builtins.getEnv` returns `""` under pure flake evaluation.** Several
  modules carry a hardcoded path with a comment saying exactly this
  (`icons.nix`, `spicetify.nix`, `tailscale.nix`). Deriving from
  `config.system.primaryUser` is the pattern. A path that silently becomes
  `/foo` instead of `/Users/jamie/foo` fails at runtime, not at build time.
- **A nix-darwin option being unset means nothing on its own.** It may be at
  Apple's default, or it may be drift. Check the machine before declaring
  anything, and read `defaults` one key at a time: parsing a whole-domain
  `defaults read` reports set keys as absent, because the output is nested.
- **nix-darwin's "The default is ..." documentation is not always current.** It
  describes several trackpad gestures as defaulting to off that macOS ships on.
  NIX-DARWIN.md lists the known-stale ones.
- **Per-host exclusions live in `excluded-apps.nix`**, keyed by short hostname.
  The old `NIX_MACOS_EXCLUDE_CASKS` environment variable is dead; the
  `dotfiles/home/.config/zsh/env.*` files that still set it are leftovers and
  nothing reads them.
- **Some macOS state is not declarable at all**, and the modules say so where it
  bites: the screen saver and wallpaper (WallpaperAgent owns the store),
  `universalaccess` (TCC blocks the activation write), and desktop widget
  placement (an NSKeyedArchiver graph in chronod's sqlite). These are per-machine
  manual steps by design, not missing configuration.
