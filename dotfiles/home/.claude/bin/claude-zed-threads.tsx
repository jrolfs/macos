/**
 * List Claude Code threads started by Zed's ACP client, with their home dirs.
 *
 * Zed drives Claude Code non-interactively over the Agent Client Protocol, so
 * the threads it starts land in the same per-project store as the terminal CLI
 * (`~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<id>.jsonl`) but with a different fingerprint:
 * the first JSONL record carries `operation: "enqueue"` and no `mode:
 * "normal"`, whereas interactive terminal sessions are `mode: "normal"` with no
 * `operation`.
 *
 * The built-in `/resume` picker mixes both together *and* is scoped to the
 * current project directory. Zed history is siloed per working directory, so
 * threads you started elsewhere never appear. This isolates the Zed/ACP threads
 * and can widen the scope to every worktree of the current repo (`--repo`) or
 * everything (`--all`).
 *
 * `--pick` opens the list as a filterable picker and writes `id<TAB>cwd` for
 * the chosen thread to stdout, which is what lets the shell function around it
 * cd into the thread's directory before resuming: the picker draws on stderr so
 * stdout carries nothing but the answer. Ink and React only load on that path,
 * so listing stays as cheap as it was.
 *
 * Any scripted `claude -p` run is also non-interactive and will appear here; in
 * a repo working directory these are almost always Zed threads in practice.
