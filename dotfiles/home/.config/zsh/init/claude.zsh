# Resume a Claude Code thread that was started by Zed's ACP client. The built-in
# `/resume` picker mixes these in with terminal sessions and is scoped to the
# current directory; Zed history is siloed per working directory, so threads
# started elsewhere never show. This narrows to just the Zed threads and can
# widen the search across the repo or everything, reattaching the chosen one
# from its own home directory.
#
# Picking happens in claude-zed-threads itself now, so there is no external
# fuzzy finder in the loop: type to filter, ↑↓ to move, ⏎ to reattach.
#
# ```sh
#   resume-zed          # threads for this project directory
#   resume-zed --repo   # every git worktree of the current repo
#   resume-zed --all    # every project on disk
#   resume-zed -d PATH  # a different project directory
# ```
