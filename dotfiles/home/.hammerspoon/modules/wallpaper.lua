-- The desktop picture, across every space.
--
-- macOS keeps the picture in a store WallpaperAgent owns rather than reads
-- (~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.wallpaper/Store/Index.plist), so
-- writing the preference does nothing: the only public way in is NSWorkspace,
-- which is hs.screen:desktopImageURL here. That paints the *active* space of
-- each screen and nothing else — System Settings writes an "all spaces and
-- displays" scope no public API reaches.
--
-- Reaching a space you are not on means hs.spaces.gotoSpace, and that works by
-- driving the Mission Control UI: it takes over the screen, and keystrokes
-- during the hop land wherever it went. Fine when you ask for it (M.walk),
-- not fine unprompted from a darwin-rebuild switch, when you may well be
-- typing. So M.apply paints the space you are on and arms a watcher, and the
-- rest are corrected as you arrive at them, invisibly.
--
-- Driven from home-manager activation (modules/home/wallpaper.nix), which is
-- where the path is declared.
